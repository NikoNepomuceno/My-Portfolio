## Common Issues & Solutions

### Text Overflow

font-size: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 1.5rem);
```

### Touch Target Size
```css
/* Solution: Ensure minimum 44px touch targets */
button, a {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
}
```

### iOS Zoom Prevention
```css
/* Solution: Use 16px font size for inputs */
input, textarea {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

### Layout Shifts
```css
/* Solution: Reserve space for dynamic content */
.image-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
  background: #f0f0f0;
}
```
